Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-10-23

	* Defense/ds.php: Changed is_blacklisted_file to is_blacklisted_db and
	modified to check the "ds_blacklist" table in the database for an IP
	address. This alleviates PHP maximum memory allocation errors on larger 
	installations where blacklist.txt grew to be too large, as we were
	previously loading it into memory. Not tested.

	* Defense/ds.ini: Remove option specifying blacklist text file since it's
	all stored in a database table now.
	
	* Defense/p10/handle_N.php: Modified to check is_blacklisted_db rather
	than the old file-based method.
	
Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-07-06

	* db_schema.sql: Add table definition for the defense service admin list.
	Also throw in a few charset declarations where they had previously been
	missing.

	* Defense/ds.php: Fix a bug wherein the blacklist text file would never be
	reloaded after modification, since PHP caches the results of filemtime for
	no good reason.

	* Operator/commands/inviteme.php: Remove an unnecessary array declaration.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-07-03

	* Operator/p10/handle_GL.php: Fix crash bug - can't report information
	about a gline we don't have!

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-07-03

	* Core/p10/handle_GL.php: Fix a bug caused by all the recent changes to
	Gline and Service::add_gline. We weren't picking up the lastmod timestamp
	when we received a GL message and as a result the reason was turning up
	empty.

	* Core/p10/handle_SQ.php: Fix a bug wherein the OS log channel message for
	SQUITs would show an empty source name if a server SQUIT itself.

	* Operator/p10/handle_SQ.php: Source determination moved to core SQ
	handler due to aforementioned bug.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-29

	* Defense/ds.php: Fix another terrible typo.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-29

	* Defense/ds.php: Fix typo.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-29

	* Defense/ds.ini: Add forgotten option to control whether DS sends gline
	requests directly to OS or performs them itself (os_gline = true would
	send all glines to OS). Also add options for a blacklist flat file, which
	by default is blacklist.txt. It should contain one IP on each line for
	every IP you wish to have blacklisted.

	* Defense/ds.php: Add is_blacklisted_file to determine whether or not the
	provided IP address is contained in our flat-file blacklist. This list is
	loaded after the first 'N' message comes through the wire, and re-loaded 
	automatically after the file is modified.

	* Defense/p10/handle_N.php: Perform check to see if a host is in the
	blacklist file upon connection.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-28

	* Core/core_globals.php: Bump revision for new Gline class changes.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-28

	* Core/gline.php: Add the lastmod TS to the Gline class.

	* Core/p10.php: Update GL token parameters to include the lastmod
	timestamp, which ircu2.10.12.12 now requires. This fixes a bug causing
	ircu to return "need more parameters" to the service every time it
	attempts to issue a GLINE or BADCHAN. This is backwards compatible with
	u2.10.11 and has been tested successfully on both versions.

	* Core/service.php: Update add_gline to accept a lastmod timestamp.

	* Defense/ds.php: Update calls to add_gline to include lastmod timestamp.

	* Operator/p10/handle_N.php: Update calls to add_gline to include lastmod
	timestamp.

	* Operator/commands/addgchan.php: Update calls to add_gline to include
	lastmod timestamp.

	* Operator/commands.gline.php: Update calls to add_gline to include
	lastmod timestamp.

	* Operator/commands/addgname.php: Update calls to add_gline to include
	lastmod timestamp.

	* Operator/commands/clearchan.php: Update calls to add_gline to include
	lastmod timestamp.

	* Operator/os.php: Update service_add_gline and all calls to add_gline to
	include lastmod timestamp.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-26

	* Core/p10/handle_GL.php: Fix bug and PHP warning.

	* Defense/p10/handle_P.php: Fix bug and PHP warning due to typo.

	* Nickname/p10/handle_P.php: Fix bug and PHP warning due to typo.

	* Operator/p10/handle_P.php: Fix bug and PHP warning due to typo.

	* Stat/p10/handle_P.php: Fix bug and PHP warning due to typo.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-26

	* Defense/p10/handle_N.php: Use *@ip instead of *ident@ip for g-lines.
	More reliable, and actually works.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-26

	* Core/service.php: Fix more stdout warnings. Not sure how these weren't
	seen in testing.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-26

	* Core/service.php: Fix massive stdout errors due to rolling back new
	event handling mechanisms.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-26

	* Defense/p10/handle_P.php: Fix broken command reporting.

	* Stat/ss.php: Remove old-style command and event reporting methods. We
	now have a Core-level method to take care of this more efficiently.

	* Stat/p10/handle_P.php: Fix broken command reporting.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-26

	* Defense/ds: Fix incorrect script references.

	* Defense/commands/access.php: Fix incorrect table name.

	* Defense/commands/adduser.php: Fix incorrect table name.

	* Defense/commands/ctcp_*.php: Added generic CTCP handlers to Defense
	Service.

	* Defense/commands/moduser.php: Fix incorrect table name.

	* Defense/commands/remuser.php: Fix incorrect table name.

	* Operator/os.ini: Since the Defense Service now performs the same types
	of scanning we were doing in the Operator Service, turn this off in the OS
	by default.

	* Stat/commands/ctcp_*.php: Add generic CTCP handlers to Stats Service.

	* Stat/commands/moduser.php: Fix incorrect table name.

	* Stat/commands/remuser.php: Fix incorrect table name.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-26

	* Channel/commands.php: Revert the ACCESS channel parameter back to the
	way it was since we now have a special case to handle ACCESS * in the
	PRIVMSG handler.

	* Channel/p10/handle_P.php: Make a special exception for the ACCESS *
	command so we don't try to look up the '*' channel name automatically.

	* Operator/p10/handle_M.php: Fixed the broken MODE log channel reporting;
	turns out we weren't even detecting the right kinds of changes. We don't
	log channel mode changes, only user mode changes. Fixed.

	* Stat/p10/handle_M.php: Fixed broken MODE handler due to recent changes
	in the Core-level MODE handler. This was causing crashes.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-25

	* Core/globals.php: Bump version to 1.3.0 in preparation for major
	release.

	* Channel/globals.php: Bump version to 1.6.0.

	* Nickname/globals.php: Bump version to 1.4.0.

	* Operator/globals.php: Bump version to 1.4.0.

	* Stat/globals.php: Bump version to 1.0.3.

	* Channel/commands/moduser.php: Now that user protection works, channel
	admins can use MODUSER PROTECT to toggle a user's protection on or off.
	Finally implemented here.

	* Channel/commands/show.php: Fix a critical bug encountered when
	enumerating the badchan list.

	* Channel/p10/handle_M.php: Fix crash bug due to typo, and several
	bugs that prevented user protection from functioning correctly.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-25

	* Core/bot.php: Fix a bug wherein the Bot::topic method was not
	actually sending a topic change when we don't pass it the channel
	timestamp. If one is not passed, it is easy to determine one. This bug
	only affected networks with topic bursting enabled, which adds a
	timestamp to the topic.

	* Core/service.php: send_mode_line was sending the wrong variable to
	sendf and parse_mode. Huge bug, but corrected. Works quite well now.
	Also, modify perform_chan_user_mode is now using send_mode_line for
	its outgoing mode processing. The rest of it needs to be removed
	after it has been proven to run stably.

	* Channel/commands/access.php: Fix a bug wherein ACCESS * username
	would only show one access record if there were more than one result.
	Also fix another crash bug due to a typo.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-25

	* Channel/commands.php: Revise the ACCESS command's argument list so 
	that automatic channel lookups are not performed on it. This is
	preventing the new admin-level multi-channel search feature from
	working (i.e., "access * brian").

	* Channel/p10/handle_P.php: Forgot to remove a print_r used in
	debugging some new stuff.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-18

	* Core/service.php: Fix bugs in parse_mode that were somehow causing
	PHP to crash (an actual segmentation fault, no warnings/errors/etc).
	Turns out we weren't ignoring the ':' mode. Also, we weren't using
	the right name nor method to obtain the relevant channel in parse_mode.

	* Core/util_string.php: Fix a bug whereby irc_sprintf and irc_vsprintf
	wouldn't pick up a conversion specifier if its type was the last
	character in the format string. In other words a string with '... %A'
	would not have been totally converted, as the 'A' would have been 
	ignored.

	* Channel/p10/handle_P.php: Use built-in Service::report_command
	instead of manually doing it.

	* Nickname/p10/handle_P.php: Use built-in Service::report_command
	instead of manually doing it.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-18

	* Core/service.php: Temporarily roll back contained handler processing,
	pretty much because it will break *everything* and should be slated for
	1.3 or 2.0. Will require a huge time investment to adjust all the 
	handlers. Also, fix typo causing immediate crash in send_mode_line.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-18

	* Core/service.php: This revision of the report_command function was
	misplaced between two different checked-out versions of the source, and
	never made it into a commit. Probably caused some very swift crashes.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-13

	* Core/service.php: Change send_mode to send_mode_line, and add send_mode
	as a quick way to send a mode change with a source object or numeric, a
	channel name, and a string with the mode change. Also, in send_mode_line,
	append the channel timestamp if one is not provided, and pass along each
	mode change line to parse_mode for internal processing.

	* Core/bot.php: Modified Bot::mode to use the new send_mode method. So
	much easier, and now keeps in-memory data structures accurate.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-13

	* Core/bot.php: Update Bot::noticef and Bot::messagef to use irc_vsprintf
	rather than the stock vsprintf.

	* Core/service.php: Clean up handler processing a little, to make it more
	readable and more sensible. Now, a handler is executed in a container
	method. The core now also has a single method to parse a mode change line,
	whether it be incoming or outgoing, and update the necessary memory 
	structures. Another new method, send_mode will examine an outgoing mode
	string, break it up if it exceeds six modes, and send it along.

	* Core/util_string.php: Add irc_vsprintf, which is equivalent to 
	vsprintf but accepts the other new, IRC-specific formatting flags as 
	irc_sprintf.

	* Core/p10/handle_M: Gutted since we now have a function to handle all
	mode changes in the core.

	* Channel/p10/handle_M.php: Fix an interesting (bugless?) typo; we were
	using the wrong argument for our source variable.

	* Channel/p10/handle_P.php: Add command reporting upon successful command
	execution.

	* Channel/commands/show.php: Add a "BAD" option to the SHOW command, so
	that admins may review the list of prohibited channel name masks.

	* Channel/commands/verify.php: Add VERIFY command to allow users to
	determine whether or not another user is a logged-in CS administrator.

	* Channel/commands.php: Add the command definition for VERIFY.

	* Nickname/p10/handle_P.php: Add command reporting upon successful command
	execution.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-09

	* Channel/cs.php: Add the is_channel_registered() method to return 
	whether or not a channel has been registered. Also added the 
	get_active_channel_users() method, which will return an array of User 
	objects that are logged in and have access to the specified channel.

	* Channel/p10/handle_K.php: Inspect all kicks in registered channels, 
	reversing any actions performed against protected users. In this case we 
	issue a DEOP against the offending user and invite the victim back into 
	the channel.

	* Channel/p10/handle_M.php: Inspect all mode changes in registered 
	channels, reversing any actions performed against protected users. In 
	this case we issue a DEOP against the offending user and either re-op or 
	re-voice the victim, or remove a ban that matches any superior, 
	protected, logged-in user.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-06-05

	* Channel/commands/access.php: First go at allowing admins to specify a
	channel wildcard in the ACCESS command, to locate all channels in which a
	particular account may have access.

	* Channel/db_channel.php: Fix a bug whereby the register_date field was
	not being populated in the database.

	* Operator/p10/handle_N.php: Fix a bug whereby clones on private IP
	addresses were being g-lined. Typical users will not be on private IP
	addresses so there is no real security risk here.

	* Stat/timers/log_history.php: Fix bug causing PHP warnings to be thrown
	as a variable was not initialized before use.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-05-22

	* Core/util_string.php: Completely rework irc_sprintf to make it more
	efficient and easier to follow. Also add tons of inline documentation
	to keep other developers sane.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-05-22

	* Core/service.php: Change include statements to reflect new convenience
	function file names.

	* Core/util_array.php: Moved array convenience functions to their own
	file.

	* Core/util_datetime.php: Moved date/time convenience functions to their
	own file.

	* Core/util_db.php: Renamed and formatted for consistency.

	* Core/util_obj.php: Moved object convenience functions to their own file.

	* Core/util_string.php: Renamed for consistency, trimmed down to
	string-specific convenience functions, and rearranged to make more sense.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-05-21

	* Core/stringutils.php: Add is_server, is_account, is_gline functions to
	test for various types of data structures. Added array_contains to return
	whether or not an element is found in an array. Added irc_sprintf to allow
	for sprintf style calls with custom flags for nick names, account names,
	channel names, server names, server numerics, user numerics, and
	space-delimited imploded arrays while only having to provide a reference
	to the object as an additional argument as opposed to the result of an
	object's method.

	* Channel/p10/handle_J.php: Convert infoline format to use irc_sprintf.

	* Operator/p10/handle_N.php: Convert reported JOIN event to use
	irc_sprintf.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-05-19

	* Operator/p10/handle_P.php: Allow other services to issue gline commands
	without having to be a global operator and without having an account.

	* Operator/os.php: Correct documentation for DNSBL lookup and fix minor
	code formatting issues. Remove debug message for private address exception
	in DNSBL lookup as it gets repeated many times for each private-IP user.

	* Operator/globals.php: Bump revision.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-05-19

	* Operator/os.php: Fix bugs that cropped up from testing the last few
	changesets. New DNSBL checks appear to be working. Changed from
	gethostbyname() to dns_get_record(), because on some systems the former
	will take 2-3 seconds each lookup for addresses that do not resolve. The
	latter takes a fraction of a second under normal conditions.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-05-19

	* Operator/os.php: Add a few more DNSBL services for checking open proxies
	and otherwise compromised hosts, and reprioritize a few others.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2009-05-19

	* Operator/os.ini: Add options for new compromised host scanning.

	* Operator/os.php: Add capabilities to check a number of DNSBL blacklist
	services to see if connecting users are running on compromised hosts. Also
	retooled Tor DNSBL check to use the generic DNSBL check function.

	* Operator/p10/handle_N.php: If COMP_GLINE is defined and enabled, run the
	compromised host check on any connecting user.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-01-24

	* Channel/db_channel.php: Fixed a bug preventing channel bans from
	being removed from the database.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-12-21

	* Nickname/globals.php: Bump version to 1.3.13.

	* Nickname/ns.php: Bug fix - reop NS when it is deopped from its log
	channel as the result of a burst.

	* Nickname/ns.ini: Add new reporting channel options and make the
	other settings more generic.

	* Channel/commands/show.php: Add the SHOW command for CS.

	* Channel/commands/adminlist.php: Removed due to obsolesence (the SHOW
	command now performs this task).

	* Channel/cs.ini: Add new reporting channel options and make the other
	settings more generic.

	* Channel/commands.php: Remove adminlist, add show.

	* Channel/globals.php: Bump version to 1.5.10.

	* Core/p10.php: Fix FMT_SERVER_SELF not having a spot to put in a
	custom MAXUSERS amount. Also added P10's JUPE formats and the account
	and away lines for WHOIS responses.

	* Core/core_globals.php: Bump version to 1.2.0.

	* Core/service.php: Add jupe tracking code and updated to reflect
	different log channel options. Also fixed a longstanding bug whereby
	no services sent the correct MAXUSERS in their server handshake line.
	They were sending the max (262144) but now send whatever is specified
	in server_maxusers in the service ini file.

	* Core/jupe.php: Add jupe class.

	* Core/p10/handle_JU.php: Add JU token handler for jupes.

	* Core/p10/handle_W.php: Add code to send account and away lines where
	appropriate in remote whois responses.

	* Core/timers/expire_jupes.php: Added to remove jupes when they
	expire.

	* Operator/globals.php: Bump version to 1.3.0.

	* Operator/os.ini: Add new reporting channel options and make the
	other settings more generic.

	* Operator/commands/inviteme.php: Send invites for both log channels
	now, instead of just the old log channel.

	* Operator/commands/jupe.php: Add JUPE command.

	* Operator/commands/unjupe.php: Add UNJUPE command.

	* Operator/commands/show.php: Add ability to list jupes, and a
	catch-all error when an invalid option is specified.

	* Operator/os.php: Added jupe-saving code, which will keep all jupes
	in a database until they expire. This ensures jupes, just like glines,
	will always be enforced between OS sessions. Modified OS to queue and
	then send all network events it sees before end-of-burst, to be sent
	to the event channel after burst. Modified the reporting code to send
	commands and events to their appropriate channels.

	* Operator/commands.php: Add JUPE and UNJUPE to command list.

	* Operator/db_jupe.php: Added DB_Jupe class, to maintain jupes in the
	services database.

	* Stat/globals.php: Bump version to 1.0.2.

	* Stat/ss.ini: Add new reporting channel options and make the other
	settings more generic.

	* Stat/ss.php: Make sure we reop SS if it is deopped in its log
	channel as the result of a burst.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-12-17

	* Core/core_globals.php: Bump version.

	* Core/p10/handle_GL.php: Fix a bug causing a warning and preventing
	the core from detecting when a gline was being removed.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-12-17

	* Core/stringutils.php: Added is_private_ip function, which calculates
	whether or not a given IP address is in an IANA-declared private
	range.

	* Operator/commands/show.php: Clear up an annoying PHP warning about
	non-existent array indices.

	* Operator/timers/reload_tor_hosts.php: Removed since we now use a Tor
	DNSBL.

	* Operator/download_tor_hosts: Removed since we now use a Tor DNSBL.

	* Operator/globals.php: Bump version and remove old Tor host file
	define.

	* Operator/os.php: Remove old Tor checking code and implement the new
	Tor DNSBL checking code, courtesy of the public Tor DNSBL at
	tor.dnsbl.sectoor.de (http://www.sectoor.de/tor.php).

	* Operator/tor-hosts.txt: Removed since we now use a DNSBL for Tor
	checks.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-12-15

	* db_schema.sql: Added table definitions for all the new badchan and
	badnick features. Forgot these in a recent commit.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-12-15

	* Operator/timers/reload_tor_hosts.php: Add a timer to automatically
	check for updates to the Tor hosts list and reload when there's been a
	modification. This is handy since we've got a cron job updating the
	file in the background every so often.

	* Operator/os.php: Add a 60-second recurring timer to check for Tor
	hosts file modifications.

	* Operator/globals.php: Bump version to 1.2.2.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-12-15

	* Channel/globals.php: Forgot to bump version.

	* Nickname/globals.php: Forgot to bump version.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-12-15

	* Channel/commands/join.php: How embarrassing... forgot to add this
	several revisions ago.

	* Channel/commands/part.php: Forgot to add this several revisions ago. 

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-12-14

	* Nickname/commands/addbad.php: Add the ADDBAD command.

	* Nickname/commands/rembad.php: Add the REMBAD command.

	* Nickname/commands/register.php: Check to see if a nick is in the
	badnicks list before allowing it to be registered.

	* Nickname/commands.php: Add the ADDBAD and REMBAD command lines.

	* Nickname/ns.php: Add badnick helper functions.

	* Nickname/db_badnick.php: Add the DB_BadNick class.

	* Channel/commands/addbad.php: Add the ADDBAD command.

	* Channel/commands/rembad.php: Add the REMBAD command.

	* Channel/commands/register.php: Check to see if a channel is in the
	badchan list before allowing it to be registered. Also fixed a bug
	where CS was not getting opped after a user uses the REGISTER command
	to register their channel.

	* Channel/commands.php: Add the ADDBAD and REMBAD command lines.

	* Channel/cs.php: Add the badchan helper functions.

	* Channel/db_badchan.php: Add the DB_BadChan class.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-12-09

	* Channel/p10/handle_I.php: Inviting CS to a channel is no longer
	solely for CS admins. If a user has access to a channel that is at
	least as high enough to issue the JOIN command, then CS will accept
	the invite and join the channel. This still works for admins as well.

	* Channel/commands/register.php: Require users to be opped in a
	channel they are attempting to register.

	* Channel/globals.php: Bump version to 1.5.8.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-12-09

	* Channel/globals.php: Forgot to bump version for last CS commit.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-12-09

	* db_schema.sql: Remove hardcoded autoincrement values. I knew I was
	forgetting something when I initially committed this file.

	* Channel/commands/rdeftopic.php: Check if we're in the channel first.

	* Channel/commands/deopall.php: Check if we're in the channel first.

	* Channel/commands/mode.php: Check if we're in the channel first.

	* Channel/commands/deop.php: Check if we're in the channel first.

	* Channel/commands.php: Add the JOIN and PART commands to the
	command map.

	* Core/p10.php: Removed some old debug messages.

	* Core/p10/handle_J.php: Fix a crash bug where ircu was sending J
	messages for channels that don't exist. This is due to the zombie
	channel feature (and the +A mode) in u2.10.12 in which a channel can
	exist either 5 minutes or 48 hours after the last user /parts it. In 
	such a case, ircu sends a J instead of a C. Silly, but must work 
	around it.

	* Core/bot.php: Modify Bot::join to account for channels that may not
	exist yet. If not, pretend this is a create() function and allocate
	everything in memory first.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-12-07

	* Operator/globals.php: Forgot to bump version to 1.2.1 in last
	commit.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-12-07

	* Operator/commands/show.php: Added the SHOW command, which accepts
	BAD, CLONES, GLINES, and OPERS as arguments.

	* Operator/commands.php: Added the SHOW command details to the command
	map.

	* Operator/db_badchan.php: Added an implicit string conversion to the
	DB_BadChan class.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-12-01

	* Operator/db_badchan.php: Fix a bug where OS considers every channel
	to be a bad channel.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-29

	* db_schema.sql: Forgot to add the table definition for badchans.
	
Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-29
	
	* Core/bot.php: Convert messagef and noticef to use vsprintf.

	* Core/core_globals.php: Convert debugf to use vsprintf. Bump version
	to 1.1.9.

	* Core/dbutils.php: Convert db_queryf to use vsprintf.

	* Core/service.php: Convert sendf to use vsprintf.

	* Core/stringutils.php: Added is_channel to determine if a variable is
	a Channel object.

	* Operator/commands/addbad.php: Add the ADDBAD command, which allows
	opers to add a word to the badchan list. When a channel is created
	and contains any words in the badchan list, it is automatically set
	with +s and enforced.

	* Operator/commands/rembad.php: Add the REMBAD command, which allows
	opers to remove a word from the badchan list.

	* Operator/p10/handle_B.php: Automatically set +s on any badchan
	channels when received in the burst.

	* Operator/p10/handle_C.php: Automatically set +s on any badchan
	channels when a user creates it.

	* Operator/p10/handle_M.php: Enforce any +s modes set on a badchan
	channel.

	* Operator/commands.php: Add the ADDBAD and REMBAD command info.

	* Operator/globals.php: Bump version to 1.2.0.

	* Operator/db_badchan.php: Add the DB_BadChan class, responsible for
	badchan DB interop and matching.

	* Operator/os.php: Implement badchan structures and necessary
	functions.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-29

	* Core/core_globals.php: Bump version.

	* Core/service.php: Added get_clone_count, which returns the number of
	connections from a specific IP address (the clone count).

	* Operator/os.ini: Added the new clone glining options. If enabled, OS
	will gline an IP address if the number of clients from a single IP
	exceeds clone_max. It will set the gline for gline_duration and the
	client will see the gline_reason when they are disconnected.

	* Operator/p10/handle_N.php: Implement clone g-lining and clean up the
	Tor g-lining code to use the Service::add_gline member.

	* Operator/os.php: Validate clone g-lining options on startup and fix
	a bug causing Tor g-lining not to work (we weren't loading the
	hosts list at startup...)

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-28

	* LICENSE: Add project name to license file.

	* (all php files): Add license declaration to the top of each source
	code file.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-28

	* Channel/commands/set.php: Fix a critical crash bug, caused by a
	simple typo.

	* Channel/p10/handle_O.php: Implemented a rough first iteration of the
	service-to-service notification. This occurs through NOTICEs to the
	bot.

	* Channel/timers/expire_channels.php: Fix a critical crash bug when we
	can no longer find a user account for a channel access record. This
	never occurred before, but it is here as a safety net anyway and also
	because the new notification system needs more testing.

	* Channel/cs.php: Use the new is_user function where necessary.

	* Channel/db_channel.php: When removing channel access from a user,
	also remove the channel access record in the database.

	* Channel/globals.php: Bump version.

	* Core/p10/handle_O.php: Add a blank handler for O (NOTICE) so that we
	don't get any "No core handler" warnings in the log when a service
	receives notices.

	* Core/bot.php: Use the new is_user function where necessary.

	* Core/core_globals.php: Define constants for use in the notification
	system. Bump version.

	* Core/service.php: Declare the default_bot member before use. Use the
	new is_user function where necessary. Also added load_single_account
	and remove_account functions for use in the notification service, as
	well as implemented the outbound notification itself. This is at the
	core level, so any service can use it.

	* Core/stringutils.php: Added is_user, which makes for much cleaner
	code when we need to check if an object is the User class (or Bot
	class, as it extends the User class).

	* Nickname/commands/drop.php: Added the DROP command file. This will
	allow NS admins to drop an account from the accounts database. As soon
	as the drop occurs, NS sends a notification to all other services
	(users with umode +k) on the network. Those other services only accept
	this notification from other +k users and perform any cleanup
	necessary to its own purpose (i.e., a channel service checks for any
	channels owned or with access and removes those records.)

	* Nickname/commands.php: Add the drop command info.

	* Nickname/globals.php: Bump version.

	* Nickname/ns.ini: Add an option for the new drop command that, when
	set to true, will not drop or purge any accounts that owns channels in
	CS. If this is not enabled, NS simply notifies CS of the deleted
	account and CS purges all owned channels and removes access records
	in channels where the account has access.

	* Operator/commands/addgchan.php: Add the ADDGCHAN command, which adds
	a badchan/glined-channel. This is a feature from u2.10.11 and up.
	Channels that are gchanned can only be entered by opers; users will be
	told that they are banned from the channel. They work exactly like
	regular g-lines and take a duration and reason.

	* Operator/commands/addgname.php: Add the ADDGNAME command, which adds
	a gline based on realnames. This is a feature in u2.10.11 and up.
	These work exactly like regular g-lines and take a duration and
	reason.

	* Operator/commands/remgchan.php: Add the REMGCHAN command, which
	removes a badchan/glined-channel.

	* Operator/commands/remgname.php: Add the REMGNAME command, which
	removes a realname-based gline.

	* Operator/commands.php: Add command info for ADDGCHAN, ADDGNAME,
	REMGCHAN, REMGNAME.

	* Operator/globals.php: Bump version.

	* Operator/os.php: Use the new is_user function where necessary.

	* Stat/ss.php: Use the new is_user function where necessary.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-24

	* LICENSE: Added the new BSD license.

	* Core/timers/refresh_data.php: Fixed a huge bug causing lots of DB
	traffic. Oops. Also removed some unnecessary debug messages.

	* Operator/download_tor_hosts: Forgot to reflect the tor-hosts file
	rename here.

	* Stat/p10/handle_J.php: Fixed a crash bug.

	* Stat/p10/handle_L.php: Fixed a crash bug.
	
Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-23

	* Core/core_globals.php: Bump version to 1.1.6.

	* Core/timers/refresh_data.php: Fix typo causing a crash.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-23

	* db_schema.sql: Missing a semicolon... whoops.

	* Channel/globals.php: Bump version to 1.5.5.

	* Channel/cs.php: Fixed a huge, very important bug. In some instances,
	CS was not treating channel names with case insensitivity. As a
	result, issuing 'showcommands #test' and 'showcommands #Test' would
	yield different results. Some level-checking and channel-locating
	functions weren't using the case-insensitive version of the name
	despite its already being there. The fix here appears to resolve the
	issue.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-23

	* .: Added svn:ignore entries for some miscellaneous files.

	* db_schema.sql: Attempt to resolve insert errors on some versions of
	MySQL when the default date was not specified and none were provided.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-23

	* .,Channel,Operator,Nickname,Stat: Added svn:ignore entries for the

	* Operator/commands/access.php: Add the ACCESS command file for
	displaying the service's internal user list.

	* Operator/commands/adduser.php: Remove query debugging.

	* Operator/commands.php: Add the ACCESS command definition.

	* Operator/globals.php: Bump version to 1.1.4.

	* Stat/commands/access.php: Add the ACCESS command file for displaying
	the service's internal user list.

	* Stat/commands/adduser.php: Remove query debugging.

	* Stat/commands.php: Add ACCESS command definition.

	* Stat/globals.php: Bump version to 1.0.1.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-23

	* Nickname/commands/set.php: Fix duplicate define reference. Also add
	the ability for admins to use SET SUSPEND on an account to suspend its
	use.

	* Nickname/commands/login.php: Do not allow users to log in if their
	account has been suspended.

	* Nickname/globals.php: Remove two defines that were already in the
	DB_User class definition.

	* Channel/timers/expire_channels.php: Remove an odd undefined
	reference that was causing PHP warnings.

	* Channel/db_channel.php: Fix a PHP warning for an undefined
	reference.

	* Core/timers/refresh_data.php: Fix a PHP warning for undefined
	references on persisted timer data.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-22

	* Operator/tor-hosts: A fresh list... why not commit. Also, renamed
	with a .txt extension. This really should have been on there before,
	but the operator service is looking for the file with a .txt
	extension. It makes more sense to have it.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-22

	* Channel/commands/showcommands.php: Major optimization to this
	command. Should definitely increase speed of the response.

	* Channel/commands.php: Add command definitions for ADDADMIN,
	DELADMIN, and ADMINLIST. These commands allow administrators to manage
	the administrator access list.

	* Channel/globals.php: Bump version 1.5.2 => 1.5.3.

	* Core/core_globals.php: Bump version 1.1.3 => 1.1.4.

	* Core/service.php: Major optimizations related to the SHOWCOMMANDS
	command. We sort each line of the command's output and reverse sort it
	by level whenever the commands are loaded, rather than doing it each
	time SHOWCOMMANDS is received.

	* Nickname/commands/showcommands.php: Major optimization to this
	command. Should definitely increase speed of the response.

	* Nickname/globals.php: Bump version 1.3.8 => 1.3.9.

	* Operator/commands/showcommands.php: Major optimization to this
	command. Should definitely increase speed of the response.

	* Operator/globals.php: Bump version 1.1.2 => 1.1.3.

	* db_schema.php: Add help for the ADDADMIN, DELADMIN, and ADMINLIST
	commands.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-20

	* db_schema.sql: Added help for new NS info command.

	* Nickname/commands/info.php: Added new info command to NS to display
	detailed information about a user account.

	* Nickname/commands/register.php: Just in case -- set the deprecated 
	register_ts.

	* Nickname/commands.php: Add command entry for the new info command.

	* Core/db_user.php: Return the new timestamp for register time /
	create date. Also add a set_register_ts just in case.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-19

	* Core/core_globals.php: Bumped version 1.1.2 => 1.1.3.

	* Operator/globals.php: Bumped version 1.1.1 => 1.1.2.

	* Operator/os.php: Remove extraneous debugging output.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-19

	* Core/service.php: Add child-level event hooks for adding and
	removing glines. If implemented in a child class, these will be called
	automagically from the parent.

	* Core/p10/handle_B.php: Remove an extraneous print_array.

	* Operator/os.php: Implemented database storage of g-lines so that
	they can be persisted across sessions. Upon startup, the service will
	burst all glines to its uplink to ensure they are all being enforced.

	* Operator/db_gline.php: Implementation of the database-level Gline
	class.

	* db_schema.sql: Added the os_glines table to store gline information.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-19

	* (all): Converted source files from DOS to UNIX linebreak formats.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-19

	* (all): Removed executable flag from non-executable files.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-19

	* Operator/commands/topic.php: Somehow this never made it into the
	trunk. Oops.

	* Operator/globals.php: Bumped version 1.1.0 => 1.1.1.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-19

	* Nickname/globals.php: Bumped version 1.3.7 => 1.3.8.

	* Channel/globals.php: Bumped version 1.5.1 => 1.5.2.

	* Channel/commands/rdeftopic.php: Fixed broken command. Topic never
	got changed in the actual channel.

	* Channel/commands/register.php: Fixed the root of the missing
	creation TS bug, causing CS to burst channels with a zero timestamp
	upon startup. This will obviously cause problems with ircu when
	sending mode hacks and other change messages. Fortunately, not any
	more.

	* Channel/cs.php: Another part of the zero-TS bug mentioned above. If
	we don't have a create TS on record, use the register TS.

	* Channel/db_channel.php: Added set_register_date member function.

	* Core/core_globals.php: Bump version 1.1.1 => 1.1.2. Also added
	CORE_VENDOR constant to be included with the core services version (as
	seen in CTCP version replies).

	* Core/dbutils.php: Moved db_date to where it really belongs and made
	it act more like PHP's date(), where the timestamp argument is
	optional.

	* Core/stringutils.php: Moved db_date to where it really belongs.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-19

	* Core/service.php: Hide timer debug messages and fix old DB_User
	constructor behavior.

	* Core/db_user.php: We no longer need to attempt to set initial data
	on a new DB_User.

	* Core/db_record.php: Remove an unnecessary debug message.

	* Nickname/commands/register.php: Fixed a few typos causing a hard
	crash.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-19

	* Channel/cs: Fix stderr/stdout redirection in some versions of sh.
	
	* Nickname/ns: Fix stderr/stdout redirection in some versions of sh.
	
	* Operator/os: Fix stderr/stdout redirection in some versions of sh.
	
	* Stat/ss: Fix stderr/stdout redirection in some versions of sh.
	
Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-19

	* Core/timers/refresh_data.php: Attempting to resolve a critical bug
	where a user's account is not recognized by other services the first
	time it is created. This is because the AC message usually comes
	through from the other service before we've loaded the DB record. When
	this occurs, we weren't checking for any users whose account name was
	set but whose account ID was not set. This should hopefully fix the
	problem.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-19

	* db_schema.sql: Forgot to include the help text for all services.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2008-11-18
	
	* Channel/globals.php: Bumped version 1.5.0 => 1.5.1.

	* Core/globals.php: Bumped version 1.1.0 => 1.1.1.

	* Nickname/globals.php: Bumped version 1.3.6 => 1.3.7.

	* Channel/cs.ini: Match db_name against database name in
	db_schema.sql.

	* Nickname/ns.ini: Match db_name against database name in
	db_schema.sql.

	* Operator/os.ini: Match db_name against database name in
	db_schema.sql.

	* Stat/ss.ini: Match db_name against database name in
	db_schema.sql.

	* db_schema.sql: Added script to use for mysql imports. Not sure why
	this wasn't included in the first release, but here it is
	nonetheless...

	* Nickname/commands/register.php: Adjustment and bug fix involving
	class member visibility.

	* Channel/commands/access.php: Adjustments for class member
	visibility.

	* Channel/commands/moduser.php: Reduced unnecessary DB traffic when
	saving channel access information.

	* Channel/commands/adduser.php: Adjustments and bug fix involving
	class member visibility.

	* Channel/timer/expire_channels.php: Removed old code that had already
	been commented out long ago.

	* Channel/db_channel.php: Minor bug fix causing STDOUT output and the
	forgotten addition of get_url and set_url.

	* Channel/cs.php: Added a check to make sure a channel could be loaded
	when we are looking for loading channel access records. Removed unused
	code and also made minor adjustments involving class member
	visibility.

	* Core/service.php: Fixed a bug whereby timers would be skipped and
	never heard from again. This would definitely have been observed on
	any server that has its time adjusted periodically, as is typical with
	a crontab running ntpdate. Also added some debug messages to verify
	timers are not being lost.

	* Core/timers/refresh_data.php: Fixed a major bug whereby new accounts
	were not being loaded. Oops.

	* Core/db_user.php: Added a set_name member function.

	* Operator/tor-hosts: Updated the list.

	* Operator/download_tor_hosts: Added this shell script so folks could
	run it in a crontab to have their tor hosts file automagically
	updated for the tor host g-lining feature. A restart is NOT necessary
	after updating the tor hosts file.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2007-11-24

	* Nickname/globals.php: Bumped version 1.3.5 => 1.3.6.

	* Channel/globals.php: Bumped version 1.4.6 => 1.5.0.

	* Core/globals.php: Bumped version 1.0.10 => 1.1.0.

	* Operator/globals.php: Bumped version 1.0.1 => 1.1.0.

	* Nickname/commands/set.php: Added ability for service admins to
	modify other users' accounts with the SET command. Cleaned up debugs.

	* Channel/p10/handle_I.php: Added the ability for service admins to
	invite the channel service back into a channel when, for whatever
	reason, it is no longer in there.

	* Channel/commands/dumpall.php: Don't output everything in memory as
	it gets large rather quickly. Just do accounts since that's all we
	really use this for.

	* Channel/commands/ban.php: Remove old debug messages and make ban
	initialization easier to read.

	* Channel/commands/dumpuser.php: Prevent PHP error/warning messages
	from being generated when an array index (account name) doesn't exist.

	* Channel/commands/topic.php: Remove old debug messages.

	* Channel/commands/kick.php: Prevent users from using the channel
	service to kick other services from a channel.

	* Channel/commands/chaninfo.php: Added the CHANINFO command to provide
	basic information about a channel.

	* Channel/commands/set.php: Add the NOPURGE option for service admins
	to mark a channel as never expiring.

	* Channel/commands/acctreload.php: Add the ACCTRELOAD command for
	developer-level debugging. This forces the service to reload an
	account from the database.

	* Channel/commands/register.php: Fix assanine typo that was probably
	used for testing. This caused users to be able to register up to MAX+8
	channels.

	* Channel/timers/save_data.php: This is no longer necessary since we
	now save all data whenever it is updated.

	* Channel/timers/expire_channels.php: Fix loop to use OO-friendly
	accessor.

	* Channel/db_channel.php: Modified to inherit new DB_Record class,
	which provides DB-level operations and a slick way of developing
	record-based classes. This makes life much easier. Also make all known
	members protected so that they cannot be directly accessed. The record
	constructor is also more flexible now and can accept just a name, or a
	name and owner account ID.

	* Channel/db_channel_access.php: Modified to inherit new DB_Record
	class. Also made things more OO-compliant.

	* Channel/commands.php: Fix some minor spacing issues, and add the
	CHANINFO command.

	* Channel/db_ban.php: Modified to inherit new DB_Record class. Also
	made things more OO-compliant.

	* Channel/cs.php: Minor reworks to constructors and debug messages.
	Removed the refresh_data timer since it is now part of the core.
	Removed old commented lines and debug messages and fixed some mode
	reconciliation issues. Also made minor OO-related changes in line with
	the changes to each class.

	* Core/core_globals.php: Added the debugf function, which acts exactly
	like printf.

	* Core/service.php: Added a core-level timer to refresh any changed DB
	data. We only refresh data that has changed since the last refresh, to
	save on nasty overhead. Also removed old debug messages.

	* Core/ban.php: Removed old debug messages.

	* Core/dbutils.php: Removed old debug messages. Added a new db_queryf
	function that accepts a query in sprintf format. Also added an
	affected-row count to the query logger.

	* Core/channeluser.php: Initialize modes to 0. Don't know if this
	fixed any bugs or not, but it should have been this way a long time
	ago.

	* Core/channel.php: Added a function to clear all bans.

	* Core/p10/handle_B.php: Fixed some bugs in the channel burst
	reconciliation process, and removed some needless stuff.

	* Core/p10/handle_I.php: Add some basic variables so services can use
	them by name rather than argument number.

	* Core/p10/handle_J.php: Add a basic convenience variable for services
	to use.

	* Core/p10/handle_N.php: Add convenience variable to show whether the
	nick NICK line is a new or existing user.

	* Core/p10/handle_S.php: Remove old debug message and add a
	convenience variable for the new server object.

	* Core/p10/handle_SERVER.php: Add convenience variable for the new
	server object.

	* Core/timers/refresh_data.php: Heavily modified to reload only
	recently modified data -- that is, any data that has changed since our
	last refresh check.

	* Core/timer.php: Modified to always provide and store timer data as
	an array.

	* Core/db_user.php: Modified to inherit new DB_Record class. Also made
	things more OO-compliant.

	* Core/db_record.php: Added to provide an abstraction layer between
	record-centric classes and across-the-board record operations
	(create/update/read/delete). This is truly a life saver.

	* Core/bot.php: Removed old debug messages.

	* Core/stringutils.php: Removed old debug messages. Added support for
	year durations. Also added a db_date function that works like date
	except returns the format we need for our DATETIME database fields.

	* Operator/os.ini: Added preferences for the new Tor glining feature.
	Admins can now specify a text file that contains one IP address or
	hostname per line that represents a Tor node. The operator service
	will read in this list and automatically gline any users connecting
	from any IP/host in the list. This is mean, sure, but Tor is often
	used by malicious users in order to quickly and very easily circumvent
	glines, channel bans, cloning restrictions, etc.

	* Operator/p10/handle_T.php: Removed old debug messages.

	* Operator/commands/set.php: Removed old debug messages.

	* Operator/tor-hosts: Added an example of a Tor host list file, to be
	used with the new Tor glining capabilities in the operator service.

	* Operator/os.php: Added code to verify and load all Tor preferences.

	* Operator/globals.php: Added global variable for the Tor hosts file
	name.

	* Stat/p10/handle_A.php: Added AWAY handler.

	* Stat/p10/handle_B.php: Added burst handler.

	* Stat/p10/handle_C.php: Added channel create handler.

	* Stat/p10/handle_AC.php: Added user account update handler.

	* Stat/p10/handle_SQ.php: Added SQUIT handler.

	* Stat/p10/handle_D.php: Added kill handler.

	finished, but the basics work well.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2007-01-07
	
	* Core/core_globals.php: Increment revision count.
	
	* Operator/globals.php: Increment revision count.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2007-01-07

	* Core/p10.php: Add numeric replies for client-side /whois responses. Also
	cleaned up several minor spacing issues.
	
	* Core/channel.php: Add an is_secret member to return whether or not the
	channel is +s.
	
	* Core/p10/handle_W.php: Added remote /whois replies to the core. These
	mostly follow the same rules as ircu-based /whoises with regard to
	user host-hiding and channel lists for services and regular users.
	Since I do not like ircu's "head-in-sand" defines, you will have to hack
	up handle_W.php if you need to hide additional information through this
	remote whois reply. However, keep in mind that if you have remote /whoises
	disabled on all your ircu servers, users will not be able to send whois 
	requests to this service and making changes to this file in order to hide
	whois info from them will not be necessary.
	
	* Core/user.php: Add last_spoke variable and corresponding get_idle_time 
	function to keep track of the last time a user has spoken. It is only
	updated inside of the Bot child class, so this is only used for remote
	whois replies about bots running on this server. Also added is_service
	function to return whether this user has +k, is_deaf() to return whether
	this user has +d, and is_local() to return if this user is on this server.
	And finally, fixed a bug that allowed a channel to be added to this user's
	channel list more than once.
	
	* Core/bot.php: Updated message() and messagef() functions to update the
	bot's last_spoke timestamp. Currently only used for whois replies about
	the bot.
	
	* Operator/p10/handle_A.php: Disable needless reporting of user away 
	status.
	
	* Operator/p10/handle_M.php: Disable reporting of channel mode changes.
	This can obviously cause a substantial amount of unnecessary log channel
	traffic on even smaller sized networks.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2006-12-20

	* Channel/globals.php: Incremented revision.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2006-12-20

	* Channel/db_channel.php: Delete channel bans whenever a channel is
	deleted. This fixes a startup bug where CS would die with a message related
	to "call to method add_ban on a non-object" when loading channel bans from
	the database for channels that had been delchan'ed or expired in the past.

	* Channel/cs.php: Added error checking for the above bug. A message will be
	logged if we come across any channel ban for a channel that does not exist.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2006-12-18

	* Channel/commands/register.php: Use new cs.ini constant for the maximum
	number of channels a user can register.

	* Channel/timers/expire_channels.php: Added timer code to automatically
	unregister channels where all owners have been absent for X days
	(configurable in cs.ini). By default, the timer runs every 5 minutes.

	* Channel/config.inc.php: Remove old constant for maximum registration
	count since it has moved to cs.ini.
	
	* Channel/cs.ini: Added value for maximum number of days a channel can be
	inactive (owner inactivity) before it is purged. Also added value for the
	maximum number of channels users are allowed to register.

	* Channel/globals.php: Incremented revision.

	* Channel/cs.php: Added new channel inactivity timer to timer stack.
	Removed old debug messages that are no longer necessary.

	* Core/service.php: Removed old debug messages that are no longer
	necessary.

	* Core/p10/handle_J.php: Removed old debug messages that are no longer
	necessary.
	
Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2006-11-25

	* Nickname/commands/ghost.php: Added GHOST command so that users can
	forcibly kill a ghost using their nick.

	* Nickname/commands.php: Added GHOST command to command list.

	* Nickname/globals.php: Incremented revision.
	
Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2006-10-28

	* Nickname/p10/handle_N.php: Only enforce a nick if it's enforce setting is
	turned on.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2006-10-28

	* Core/service.php: Added a kill() function to the service class. This will
	perform a server-based kill.

	* Core/p10.php: Added protocol format line for kills.

	* Core/bot.php: Added a kill() function to the bot class. This will perform
	a user-based kill.

	* Channel/p10/handle_J.php: Remove old debug messages.

	* Nickname/p10/handle_N.php: Added a timer line to make sure we are
	enforcing nicks with kills.

	* Nickname/timers/enforce.php: Added nick enforcement code.

	* Nickname/globals.php: Added constant for the Nickserv timer directory.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2006-10-21

	* Channel/commands/help.php: Fix small bug where help text variables
	were not being substituted before the text was sent out.

	* Channel/cs.php: More accomodations for proper channel bursts. If we
	receive a channel create timestamp that is smaller than the one we have
	stored, update it accordingly.

	* Channel/globals.php: Update revision count.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2006-10-16

	* Operator/commands/*: Added moduser, remuser, and adduser command
	handlers.

	* Operator/os.php: Modified get_user_level() to accept an integer as well
	so we can search for access by an account ID.

	* Operator/commands.php: Added lines for adduser, moduser, and remuser.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2006-10-14

	* Core/core_globals.php: Increment revision count.

	* Core/p10.php: Add formatter for the SETTIME token.

	* Core/service.php: The 'r' mode wasn't covered in clear_modes(). Also
	fixed a bug that wasn't updating the internal copy of a channel topic
	whenever the service set it. Modified the kick() function to allow for
	either a single numeric of a user to kick, or an array with multiple users.

	* Core/channel.php: Added get_op_list(), get_voice_list(), and
	get_user_list() to return an array of numerics that are ops, voices, or all
	channel users, respectively.

	* Core/user.php: Added get_signon_ts() to return the user's signon
	timestamp, and get_channel_list() to return an array of channel names that
	the user is joined to.

	* Core/stringutils.php: Added a standard get_date() function to convert a
	timestamp to a readable date/time in various places.

	* Operator/commands.php: Rearranged command list by level. Also added
	command lines for whois, whoison, settime, and clearchan.

	* Operator/commands/whois.php: Added WHOIS command to return information
	about a signed-on user.

	* Operator/commands/settime.php: Added SETTIME command to allow operator
	services to send out a network-wide timestamp so that all servers have the
	correct time.

	* Operator/commands/clearchan.php: Added CLEARCHAN command to allow opers
	to clear a channel's modes, deop all its users, devoice all its users,
	clear all its bans, kick all its users, or gline all its users. In cases
	where an oper requests to kick or gline all channel users, the service will
	make sure not to kick/gline the oper requesting the clearchan if they are
	on the channel at the time. It also will not perform actions on any service
	bots.

	* Operator/commands/whoison.php: Added WHOISON command to allow opers to
	see who is on a channel at any given time. The list is sorted
	alphabetically and includes @ and + characters to indicate op/voice status
	for users on the channel.

Brian Cline <brian@ircplanet.net>	2006-10-13

	* Core/bot.php: Make various adjustments to ensure that we send the proper
	timestmap with a channel mode change, thus avoiding any messy HACK(2)'s.
	
	* Operator/commands/*: Added chanlist and scan commands.
	
	* Operator/commands.php: Added chanlist and scan commands.

	* Operator/commands/clearmodes.php: Mode change should go through as
	server, not bot.

Brian Cline	<brian@ircplanet.net>	2006-10-09

	* Initial subversion import.
