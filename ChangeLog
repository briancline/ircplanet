	* Channel/commands/help.php: Fix small bug where help text variables
	were not being substituted before the text was sent out.

	* Channel/cs.php: More accomodations for proper channel bursts. If we
	receive a channel create timestamp that is smaller than the one we have
	stored, update it accordingly.

	* Channel/globals.php: Update revision count.

	* Operator/commands/*: Added moduser, remuser, and adduser command
	handlers.

	* Operator/os.php: Modified get_user_level() to accept an integer as well
	so we can search for access by an account ID.

	* Operator/commands.php: Added lines for adduser, moduser, and remuser.

	* Core/core_globals.php: Increment revision count.

	* Core/p10.php: Add formatter for the SETTIME token.

	* Core/service.php: The 'r' mode wasn't covered in clear_modes(). Also
	fixed a bug that wasn't updating the internal copy of a channel topic
	whenever the service set it. Modified the kick() function to allow for
	either a single numeric of a user to kick, or an array with multiple users.

	* Core/channel.php: Added get_op_list(), get_voice_list(), and
	get_user_list() to return an array of numerics that are ops, voices, or all
	channel users, respectively.

	* Core/user.php: Added get_signon_ts() to return the user's signon
	timestamp, and get_channel_list() to return an array of channel names that
	the user is joined to.

	* Core/stringutils.php: Added a standard get_date() function to convert a
	timestamp to a readable date/time in various places.

	* Operator/commands.php: Rearranged command list by level. Also added
	command lines for whois, whoison, settime, and clearchan.

	* Operator/commands/whois.php: Added WHOIS command to return information
	about a signed-on user.

	* Operator/commands/settime.php: Added SETTIME command to allow operator
	services to send out a network-wide timestamp so that all servers have the
	correct time.

	* Operator/commands/clearchan.php: Added CLEARCHAN command to allow opers
	to clear a channel's modes, deop all its users, devoice all its users,
	clear all its bans, kick all its users, or gline all its users. In cases
	where an oper requests to kick or gline all channel users, the service will
	make sure not to kick/gline the oper requesting the clearchan if they are
	on the channel at the time. It also will not perform actions on any service
	bots.

	* Operator/commands/whoison.php: Added WHOISON command to allow opers to
	see who is on a channel at any given time. The list is sorted
	alphabetically and includes @ and + characters to indicate op/voice status
	for users on the channel.

	* Core/bot.php: Make various adjustments to ensure that we send the proper
	timestmap with a channel mode change, thus avoiding any messy HACK(2)'s.
	
	* Operator/commands/*: Added chanlist and scan commands.
	
	* Operator/commands.php: Added chanlist and scan commands.

	* Operator/commands/clearmodes.php: Mode change should go through as
	server, not bot.
